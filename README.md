# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

This command line application will prompt the user through a series of questions that initially gather information about the team's manager, and then allows the user to choose which additional types of team members they want to add to the team. The user can then to either add an engineer or an intern to the team, or they can finish. The application will prompt specific questions depending on which type of employee the user chooses to add, and then will ask if they want to add another or not. When the user is done adding employees, an HTML file is populated with other HTML files that contain each team member's profile information. The application uses the node module 'jest' to test the code to ensure proper functionality, and the module 'inquirer' to prompt the questions and collect input  in the command line.
